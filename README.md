### Breath first Maze solver

## TODO

* path from start to finish
* start at any position
* maze struct in seperat file

## Execution

> cargo run

## Future ideas

* distribution of solveable mazes dependent on weights and sizes
* visual output
* variable size of maze
* variable start 7 endpoint
* 3D
* simulate lightning by recursive execution
